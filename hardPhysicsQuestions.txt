In the absence of air resistance, a ball of mass m is tossed upward to reach a height of 20 m. At the 10-m position, half way up, the net force on the ball is
When you drop a ball it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s2. If you instead throw it downward, then its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand, assuming no air resistance, is
A cannonball is fired horizontally at 10 m/s from a cliff. Its speed one second after being fired is about
Relative to the ground, an airplane gains speed when it encounters wind from behind, and loses speed when it encounters wind head on. When it encounters wind at a right angle to the direction it is pointing, its speed relative to the ground below
A karate chop delivers a force of 3000 N to a board that breaks. The force that the board exerts on the hand during this event is
