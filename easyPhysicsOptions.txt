	they emit light of a constant intensity
	their distance from the earth does not change with time
	they are very far away from the earth resulting in decrease in intensity of light
	they are nearer to earth and hence we receive a greater amount of light and, therefore minor variations in the intensity are not noticeable
	they contain free electrons
	the atoms are lightly packed
	they have high melting point

	the intensity of light emitted by them changes with time
	the distance of the stars from the earth changes with time
	the refractive index of the different layers of the earth's atmosphere changes continuously, consequently the position of the image of a start changes with time
	the light from the star is scattered by the dust particles and air molecules in the earth's atmosphere
	in the hills the atmospheric pressure is lower than that in the plains and therefore water boils at a temperature lower than 100oC causing an increase in cooking time
	due to low atmospheric pressure on the hills, the water boils at a temperature higher than 100oC and therefore water takes longer to boil
	in the hills the atmospheric density is low and therefore a lot of heat is lost to the atmosphere
	in the hills the humidity is high and therefore a lot of heat is absorbed by the atmosphere leaving very little heat for cooking
