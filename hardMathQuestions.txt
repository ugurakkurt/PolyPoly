Suppose two cards are drawn from a standard 52 card deck without replacement (which means when we draw a card, we don't put it back). Assuming all cards are equally likely to be selected, what is the probability that the second card is an ace given that the first card is an ace?
Suppose two cards are drawn from a standard 52 card deck without replacement (which means when we draw a card, we don't put it back). Assuming all cards are equally likely to be selected, what is the probability that the second card is not an ace given that the first card is not an ace?
